# Oneshot For 3DS
A Port of the Freeware (2014) Ver. of Oneshot for the 3DS. thanks to Gridd for helping me fix all the bugs that i had barely no clue how to fix XD
keep in mind i had to change alot of things to get it to work so its not a 100% like the actual 2014 ver. of oneshot.

# **for those finding this recently again, i am working on a new version with a ton of fixes, and once it's done i will make a video guide alongside the already existing Text guide here.**

Here's how to get Oneshot to Work on your 3DS:
First of all you need to have a Modded 3DS or else it wont work.
1. download EasyRPG 3DS by going to the main site: https://easyrpg.org/player/downloads/
tab on "other" at the 0.8 "Paralyze" version and download "Nintendo 3DS (CIA)"
2. download the Oneshot folder: Now on github with release 1.1.0!
3. install the EasyRPG.Cia file to your 3DS.
4. make a folder called easyRPG-player inside the SD\3ds folder and place
the oneshot folder inside. it should look like this SD:\3ds\easyRPG-player\Oneshot 3DS
5. open up EasyRPG and if you see oneshot, congrats! you can now play
oneshot on your 3DS.
6. Have fun!
