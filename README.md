A Port of the 2014 Ver. of Oneshot for the 3DS. A HUGE thanks to Gridd for helping me fix all the bugs. without him, this project would never have existed &lt;3

Here's how to get Oneshot to Work on your 3DS:
1. download easyRPG 3DS:

3. downlaod the EasyRPG.Cia file
4. make a folder called easyRPG-player inside the SD/3ds folder and place
the oneshot folder inside.
