Here's how to get Oneshot to Work on your 3DS:
First of all you need to have a Modded 3DS or else it wont work.
1. download EasyRPG 3DS by going to https://easyrpg.org/player/downloads/#release-homebrew and download "Nintendo 3DS (3dsx)"
2. download the Oneshot folder: Now on github with release 1.1.0!
3. Unzip the folder and put it inside SD/3ds.
4. place the Oneshot 3DS folder inside the easyrpg-player folder. it should be like this "SD:\3ds\easyrpg-player\Oneshot 3DS"
5. open up Homebrew Channel and Scroll down until you find "EasyRPG Player 0.8.1". Open it and if you see Oneshot 3DS, congrats! you can now play
oneshot on your 3DS.
6. Have fun!

If you make a Save File when going into one of the beds, you can load back into them when Reopening the game by just pressing select on the Empty Spot Between Start and Quit.
