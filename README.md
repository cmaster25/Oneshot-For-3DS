# Oneshot For 3DS
A Port of the Freeware (2014) Ver. of Oneshot for the 3DS. thanks to Gridd for helping me fix all the bugs that i had barely no clue how to fix XD
keep in mind i had to change alot of things to get it to work so its not a 100% like the actual 2014 ver. of oneshot.

### **⚠️For those finding this recently, i am working on a new version with a ton of fixes like fixing the beds, the Music etc. and once it's done i will make a video guide alongside the already existing Text guide here! It will take a bit cus I'm having to juggle between this, work and more so please be patient!⚠️**

Here's how to get Oneshot to Work on your 3DS:
First of all you need to have a Modded 3DS or else it wont work.
1. download EasyRPG 3DS by going to https://easyrpg.org/downloads/player/0.8/ and download "Nintendo 3DS-CIA" because 0.8.1 currently breaks some things
2. download the Oneshot folder: Now on github with release 1.1.0!
3. install the EasyRPG.Cia file to your 3DS.
4. make a folder called easyRPG-player inside the SD\3ds folder and place
the oneshot folder inside. it should look like this SD:\3ds\easyRPG-player\Oneshot 3DS
5. open up EasyRPG and if you see oneshot, congrats! you can now play
oneshot on your 3DS.
6. Have fun!
