# Oneshot-For-3DS
A Port of the 2014 Ver. of Oneshot for the 3DS. A HUGE thanks to Gridd for helping me fix all the bugs. without him, this project would never have existed &lt;3

Here's how to get Oneshot to Work on your 3DS:
First of all you need to have a Modded 3DS or else it wont work.
1. download EasyRPG 3DS:
https://wiidatabase.de/3ds-downloads/spiele/easyrpg-player/
2. download the oneshot folder: https://www.mediafire.com/file/6vw3hyba8b2vev4/Oneshot_3DS.rar/file (cus file is too large for github oof)
3. downlaod the EasyRPG.Cia file
4. make a folder called easyRPG-player inside the SD/3ds folder and place
the oneshot folder inside.
5. open up EasyRPG and if you see oneshot, congrats! you can now play
oneshot on your 3DS.
6. Have fun!
