# Oneshot For 3DS
A Port of the Freeware (2014) Ver. of Oneshot for the 3DS. A HUGE thanks to Gridd for helping me fix all the bugs. without him, this project would never have existed &lt;3
keep in mind i had to change alot of things to get it to work so its not a 100% like the actual 2014 ver. of oneshot.

Here's how to get Oneshot to Work on your 3DS:
First of all you need to have a Modded 3DS or else it wont work.
1. download EasyRPG 3DS by going to the main site: https://easyrpg.org/player/downloads/
tab on "other" at the 0.7.0 "Sword" version and download "Nintendo 3DS (CIA)"
2. download the Oneshot folder: Now on the github with release 1.1.0!
3. install the EasyRPG.Cia file to your 3DS.
4. make a folder called easyRPG-player inside the SD/3ds folder and place
the oneshot folder inside.
5. open up EasyRPG and if you see oneshot, congrats! you can now play
oneshot on your 3DS.
6. Have fun!
